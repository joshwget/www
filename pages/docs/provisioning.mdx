## Adding a new device

Adding a device is as easy as running a Docker container. The Docker container launched onto each device is an agent container that is used to talk back to Deviceplane. For each device that you want to add, a unique device registration ID must be used as part of the Docker command. Click on the Add Device button to grab a unique Docker command for the device. If you are looking to add more than one device at a time, youâ€™ll need to re-generate a new command to obtain a unique token for each device.
