<Docs title="Self-hosted">

Deviceplane is available in two forms: as a managed service available at [cloud.deviceplane.com](https://cloud.deviceplane.com/) and as an open source project that can be installed on your own infrastructure. The self-hosted section of our documentation contains information on how to setup Deviceplane on your own. Usage of Deviceplane between the managed version and a self-hosted version is nearly identical and so we don't maintain seperate documentation on how to use a self-hosted Deviceplane installation.

**Self-hosted Deviceplane is currently in beta.** We make make no guarantees about the stability of a self-hosted install and critical workflows such as upgrading and rolling back are not currently supported.

We currently have documentation for two self-hosted use cases.

- **[Local network setup](./local-setup)** The first guide sets up Deviceplane for use within a local network. This is the simplest way to try out Deviceplane, though it isn't capable of managing remote devices or devices on a different network.
- **[Public setup](./public-setup)** This guide sets up Deviceplane publicly using DigitalOcean as an example cloud provider. This setup can be used to manage remote devices, but it should still *not* be considered a production setup.

## Deviceplane Docker images

The Deviceplane backend consists of two components.

- **Controller** The Deviceplane backend service.
- **Database** A MySQL database with the Deviceplane schema.

Deviceplane maintains two Docker images. 

- **`deviceplane/deviceplane`** Contains both the controller and an embedded MySQL with the schema preloaded. Used for the two documented self-hosted use cases. 
- **`deviceplane/controller`** Contains only the controller. Used when you want to connect to an external MySQL database. 

Setups using an external database are not yet documented.
