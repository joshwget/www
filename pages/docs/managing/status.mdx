<Docs title="Device Status">

Device status is what gives you a quick dashboard of the state of your devices. The "status" column itself is often the most useful, but Deviceplane also provides some other useful information about your devices in the _Devices_ page.

# Specifics

Since most devices cannot be expected to have perfect network connectivity, the "status" column is not a realtime column. Rather, it checks whether a device has been online within the last two minutes. If you shut down a device, and it still shows as online, this is the likely reason why.
