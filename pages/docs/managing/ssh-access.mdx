<Docs title="SSH Access">

SSH is available through both the UI and CLI. To use SSH in the UI nagivate to the devices page, then to a specific device, and then to the SSH tag. You should then have access to an interactive terminal in your browser.

To SSH via the CLI run the following command. The project and device need to be defined to pick the device to SSH into.

```
$ deviceplane ssh --project <PROJECT_ID_OR_NAME> --device <DEVICE_ID_OR_NAME>
```

## Running commands via SSH

Beyond spawning interactive shells SSH can also be used to remotely execute commands on a device. This functionality is currently only available through the CLI.

To run commands via the CLI append the command you wish to run to the SSH command from above. For example, suppose we wanted to run `cat /etc/os-release` to see details on what Linux distribution a device is running.

```shell
$ deviceplane ssh --project <PROJECT_ID_OR_NAME> --device <DEVICE_ID> cat /etc/os-release
