# Device labels

Each device can have labels associated with it, which are key value pairs. These labels can be used to group devices to control the deployment of your application. Scheduling rules are used to determine if an application should be deployed by comparing what labels are on or not on a device.

Once a label is created, you can only edit the value of the label. If you want to update the key, you will need to remove the label and re-add it to the device.
