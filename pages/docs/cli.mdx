<Docs title="CLI">

The Deviceplane CLI can be used to manage the releases in applications, SSH into devices in a project and used to help manage your projects and applications. Besides personal preference of using a CLI versus UI, another great use case of the CLI is to use it in an existing CI/CD system to deploy new releases directly into Deviceplane.

The CLI can be downloaded for the OS that is being used under the user dropdown located in the upper right hand corner of the UI.

## Access key

When using the CLI, an access key must be provided. Without this access key, Deviceplane will not be able to authenticate the request. Each user or service account can create access keys to use for the CLI. User access keys are scoped to a specific user and will have the same role as a user. Service account access keys are great to use when a service is being set up to make changes into Deviceplane. For example, it's best to use a service account access key instead of a user access key for CI/CD systems.

The access key can be set as an environment variable `$DEVICEPLANE_ACCESS_KEY` or as an option, `--access-key value` in any command.

Setting the access key as an environment variable is recommended so that it doesn't need to be constantly passed with every command. Even if the access key has been set as an environment variable, it can always be overridden by setting it directly in the command.
