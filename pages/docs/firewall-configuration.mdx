<Docs title="Firewall Configuration">

If you're managing devices in an enterprise or corporate environment, there's a good chance of a firewall preventing non-whitelisted connections. Deviceplane will require certain amendments to this whitelist to allow operating behind the firewall.

The following table shows the whitelist requirements that will need to be made.

| Domain | IP addresses | Additional requirements |
| --- | --- |
| scloud.deviceplane.com | 75.2.126.40, 99.83.169.232 | WebSockets |
| downloads.deviceplane.com | 13.248.208.54, 76.223.78.246 | - |

Note that the domain is `scloud.deviceplane.com` and not `cloud.deviceplane.com`. Normally the Deviceplane agent makes requests to `cloud.deviceplane.com`, but this domain does not resolve to static IP addresses yet. This is something we aim to fix soon, but for now `scloud.deviceplane.com` must be used.

There is one additional step to make the Deviceplane agent connect to `scloud.deviceplane.com`. An extra environment variable, `CONTROLLER=https://scloud.deviceplane.com/api`, needs to be added to the installation command.

For example, suppose your installation command as given in the UI is the following.

```
curl https://downloads.deviceplane.com/install.sh | VERSION=<version> PROJECT=<project> REGISTRATION_TOKEN=<registration_token> bash
```

The resulting command including the extra environment variable would be the following.

```
curl https://downloads.deviceplane.com/install.sh | VERSION=<version> PROJECT=<project> REGISTRATION_TOKEN=<registration_token> CONTROLLER=https://scloud.deviceplane.com/api bash
```
