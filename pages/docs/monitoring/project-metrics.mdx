<Docs title="Project Metrics">

Project metrics contain information about the state of your project. These metrics come out-of-the box, and only need to be configured in the UI.

Currently, the only project metric is the "devices" metric. This metric has a "status" tag which can be either "online" or "offline". You can use this metric to see how many devices are online, as well as to see which devices those are, by tagging the device name.

To enable this (and all future project metrics):

1. Open Project metrics _(Monitoring > Project Metrics)_
1. Optionally add labels and the device tag
1. Enable the metric
